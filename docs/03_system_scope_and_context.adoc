== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

The main objetive of DeDeportes is to create a sports store with products related to sports. The application that contains the online store is going to be descentralized
and also be based on Solid so each client will have its own POD. This POD stores the users information and it cannot be acceded unless the user authorized it. The most
frequent user of this appplication is going to be the client interested in sport products.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

|Element|Input|Output
|User|Recipe|Products that the client want
|POD|User info|Shipping Address
|Database|Client order|Products
|App (DeDeportes)|Order/Products|Recipe/Client Order

First of all the client should sign in the POD sending his information. Then he can pick up products to make the order, once he ended the POD send the shipping address to make the full order and it´s send to the database for a future send.
The product´s info are given to the application by the database.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

|Technology | Description of usage
|SOLID architecture|Is used for the secure management of the user data furthermore this data is decentralized
|POD| Where the application is going to take the user data, if he allows it. POD stores the user information.
|TypeScript| Is the language used to generate the events of the store. It is a JavaScript versión with syntax control
|React| Is an open-source library that helps the team to make the GUI with the help of TypeScript
|React-Hot-Toast| Is an api that allows us to make floating notifications to the user
|MUI| Is a library that help us on the view of the application
|Cloudinary| Its the repository where we store the images of the products
