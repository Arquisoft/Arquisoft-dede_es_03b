== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

The runtime view describes the possible interactions of the different actors with the application.

This will help us understand how the elements of the application interact at runtime.
The next schemes are some scenarios of our sport online shop.

=== Login with POD

1. Client will choose My Profile in the home page.
2. Client will choose in the menu the Login option.
3. The client will be redirect to the Login page, where he has to press the Login Pod button and then, fill the gaps with his information.
4. The client will be sent to the Pod's supplier page.
5. The Pod will accept or not the data provided.
6. If the data is right the client will be redirect to the login page.
7. If the data is wrong the client will continue in the Pod's supplier page.

=== Get the content of the shopping cart

1. Client will login in the application.
2. The client will try to see the content of his shopping cart.
3. The application is going to ask the database for that information.
4. The database will return the list of products.
5. Finally, the application will show the list to the client.

=== Login as an admin 

1. Client will choose My Profile in the home page.
2. Client will choose in the menu the Login option.
3. The client will be redirect to the Login page, where he has to press the Login Admin button and then, fill the gaps with his information.
4. If the information is right a success notification will appear.
5. If the information is wrong a failure notification will appear.
