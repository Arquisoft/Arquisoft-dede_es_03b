=== Domain model

Although for the project we are using MongoDB, which is a non-relational database, our data model will be based on a model of entities and relationships.

=== Domain concepts

DeDeportes will be based in the sale of sport products.

* *POD:* will store the individual information of each user as a repository following the SOLID specifications.
* *Order:* will be an order of products of the store done by the user.
* *Product:* will be all the sport materials available to buy by all the users in the store.
* *OrderedProduct* will store the products of the multiple orders. Each one will have the product´s id and the order´s id.
* *User* used for administration purposes.

In our application there´s going to be an administrator wich information is going to be stored in the user collection.

=== Development concepts

React is a JavaScript-based library, used for doing user interfaces. Facebook and open-source developers run it.

MongoDb will be used to store the products, the users, the users' orders and the ordered products.

Node.js is the package manager choosen to build the application.

For the time being we haven't decided what are we using to make tests.

=== User Interface

The default user interface for DeDeportes is a Multiple Page Application written in TypeScript using React together with default Bootstrap and MUI templates.

For the POD login we use Solid authentication and the POD API.

=== Security

DEDE offers security for its API endpoints only via HTTP basic access authentication. Also by using the POD API we can check the user's permissions and access only the resources that the user has given permissions.

=== Internationalization

Only supported language is Spanish. There is no hook for doing internationalization in the frontend and there are no plans for creating one for now.

=== Testability

The project contains .ts test using jest on both restapi and webapp, also on the e2e test. Our objective is get the most coverge of the code.
