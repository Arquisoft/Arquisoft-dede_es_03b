== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== 8.1 Domain model

=== 8.2 Domain concepts

DeDeportes will be based in the sale of sport products.

* *User:* will represent the client that uses the application. His main information will be stored for buying in the store.
* *POD:* will store the individual information of each user as a repository following the SOLID specifications.
* *Order:* will be an order of products of the store done by the user.
* *Shopping cart:* will actualize the different products that the user wants to order. The user can add or delete products in the shopping cart.
* *Product:* will be all the sport materials available to buy by all the users in the store.
* *Credit Card:* each user can have more than one credit cards associated t buy in the store.
* *Administrator:* could do changes in the application.

=== 8.3 Development concepts

React is a JavaScript-based library, used for doing user interfaces. Facebook and open-source developers run it.

MongoDb will be used to store the products, the users, the users' orders and shopping carts.

Node.js is the package manager choosen to build the application.

For the time being we haven't decided what are we using to make tests.

=== 8.4 User Interface

The default user interface for DeDeportes is a Multiple Page Application written in TypeScript using React together with default Bootstrap and MUI templates.

For the POD login we use Solid authentication and the POD API.

=== 8.5 Security

DEDE offers security for its API endpoints only via HTTP basic access authentication. Also by using the POD API we can check the user's permissions and access only the resources that the user has given permissions.

=== 8.6 Internationalization

Only supported language is English. There is no hook for doing internationalization in the frontend and there are no plans for creating one for now.
