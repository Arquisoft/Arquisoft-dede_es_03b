== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

=== Using a nonSQL database for saving data.
.Problem
Using normal SQL database like HSQLDB for this project is a good choice considering that we have knowledge and practice with this tipe, but in the face of pure documentation and examples MongoDb its a better alternative that fits in this project usisg a MERN frame. 

.Decision
Use MERN as teh project structure.

=== Using POD
.Problem
We need that the users allow the application to access to their information.

.Decision
We will use the userÂ´s PODs to access to their information.
