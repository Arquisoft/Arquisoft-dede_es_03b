=== Quality Scenarios


==== Security
By saving on the SOLID PODs the information of the user and also by only having esential info on the database. Also we encrypt the data of the petitions.

==== Testability / Coverage
We use Codecov and Sonarcloud during development to get the most coverage of our code. Also we are using js tests for testing both restapi and webapp, Jest for e2e tests and gatling for performance tests. This ensure code and app quality.

==== Eficency
We need to ensure a fast conection and transaction between the user and the app. Galting is used to ensure this.
