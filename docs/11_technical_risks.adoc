== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Risks
[options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Explication
|GitHub|Despite having already worked on several subjects with this tool, there is still a part of ignorance that can lead to conflict resolutions.
|React|For many of the development team it will be their first time working with it. So we will have to spend time learning the basics concepts.
|SOLID|This is the first project where we have to introduce SOLID principles. So it will take time to get a good grasp of the technique.
|MongoDB|Until now we have always used other types of database management systems. MongoDB is a new challenge that the team will face. In this case, having used databases in many other subjects, the learning time may be less
|Security|Keeping customer information secure is a vitally important activity. For this, we must find out how to make a security and authentication system as effective as possible.
|Team|Working in teams with a certain number of people is never a simple task. The best solution is to hold weekly meetings to get to know each other and have constant communication to solve any problem that arises together.
|Pod´s| During the project, mastery of this technology led to different problems that were resolved
|URL Api test| Despite trying to use the .env file to make the connection to the database, we had to hardcode it
|Deployment| The deployment of the application has been a problem. At first we had chosen heroku but we ended up doing it on Amazon

=== Tecnical Debts
[options="header"]
|===
| Problem | Explication
| Pod´s data in deployment | Due to using amazon web service as a means of deployment, when testing the deployed application it is not allowed to access the information of the pods.
| Double order creation | When an order is created from the application, an extra order is generated for each payment. After reviewing the project we have not found the error
| Test e2e | During the test we have not been able to access the menu buttons, so a not found error appeared. The solution we have taken has been to carry out the tests even if they fail
| Menu nav | When you start using the pods in the application, the application's nav menu changes color
| Hardcoding | The compatibility between the URLs of the connections in the .env file and the deployment has given problems. The solution taken has been to hardcode and use the NOSONAR comment
