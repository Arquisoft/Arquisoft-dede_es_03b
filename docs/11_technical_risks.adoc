| Risk | Explication
|GitHub|Despite having already worked on several subjects with this tool, there is still a part of ignorance that can lead to conflict resolutions.
|React|For many of the development team it will be their first time working with it. So we will have to spend time learning the basics concepts.
|SOLID|This is the first project where we have to introduce SOLID principles. So it will take time to get a good grasp of the technique.
|MongoDB|Until now we have always used other types of database management systems. MongoDB is a new challenge that the team will face. In this case, having used databases in many other subjects, the learning time may be less
|Security|Keeping customer information secure is a vitally important activity. For this, we must find out how to make a security and authentication system as effective as possible.
|Team|Working in teams with a certain number of people is never a simple task. The best solution is to hold weekly meetings to get to know each other and have constant communication to solve any problem that arises together.
